Welcome to the BLITZ 0p3rations Blog âš¡!

I am Gabi, a 23-year-old Penetration Tester working for a consulting company. With three years of experience, I have executed various types of engagements, including:

- Vulnerability Assessment
- Internal Network Penetration Test
- Web Application Penetration Test & API Testing
- External Perimeter Penetration Test
- Mobile Application Penetration Test
- Social Engineering and Spear Phishing Simulations
- Wireless Penetration Test

I have successfully obtained several recognized certifications in the offensive security field:

- eCCPTv2 - eLearnSecurity
- Burp Suite Certified Practitioner - Portswigger
- API Penetration Testing - APIsec University

My next steps are going to be CRTP -> CRTO.

My career objective is to reach a level of expertise where I can effectively emulate advanced persistent threats, similar to nation-state actors or well-funded groups. 
Currently, I specialize in web security, conducting in-depth assessments of web applications and external perimeters for tier-one companies and banks. 

In the future, I aim to transition to performing full-spectrum red teaming operations, encompassing everything from bypassing physical access controls to cyber operations.
My deep cross-field interest in intelligence and geopolitical analysis through open-source intelligence techniques drives me to expand my knowledge and skillset continuously.

In the evening I enjoy the following:

- Learning new techniques and attacks.
- Emulating and replicating OSINT investigations in the geopolitical field.
- Reading books.

Currently, I am seeking a Penetration Tester position in the Netherlands, where I can continue to perform web penetration testing activities, with opportunities to engage in more internal network-related engagements through assumed breach scenarios.

This blog is a platform where I share knowledge and tactical techniques, and discuss various topics related to Intelligence, Hacking, and other subjects that interest me.
