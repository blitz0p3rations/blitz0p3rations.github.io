The Israel-Iran conflict, a longstanding geopolitical rivalry, extends beyond the realm of cyber warfare into various domains including military confrontations, espionage, and strategic influence in the Middle East. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

# Introduction

The conflict between Israel and Iran in the cybersecurity field has been ongoing for years. Both countries have been accused of using government institutions to carry out cyber attacks against each other. According to a report by the Washington Post, the cyber war between Iran and Israel has intensified in recent years. Iran has been accused of carrying out cyber attacks against Israeli targets, including government institutions and critical infrastructure1. Israel has also been accused of carrying out cyber attacks against Iran’s nuclear program.

One of the most famous incidents between these two countries was the Stuxnet worm attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 20101. The worm was reportedly developed by the United States and Israel1. The attack caused significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program and set back its progress by several years1.

Both countries have also been targeted by advanced persistent threats (APTs). APT34 is a group that is believed to be sponsored by the Iranian government. The group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications2. In November 2022, CISA and FBI released a joint CSA about an incident at an FCEB organization in which Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploited a Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server3.

Cyber activity can have significant geopolitical implications. Cyber attacks can be used as a tool for espionage or sabotage. They can also be used to disrupt critical infrastructure or cause economic damage. Cybersecurity is an important issue that affects not only individual users but also governments and businesses around the world.

# Real panorama

According to a report by the Washington Post, Iran and Israel have been engaged in a cyber-war that has become more intense over the past year. Iranian hackers, contracted by the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, targeted prominent Israeli companies in a series of ransomware attacks in September 20222. In June 2022, Iran’s state-owned Khuzestan Steel Co. and two other steel companies were forced to halt production after suffering a cyberattack1. Israel’s defence secretary then ordered an investigation into a leaked video showing the damage to the steel plants1.

The conflict between Iran and Israel in the cybersecurity field has been ongoing for years. Both countries have been accused of using government institutions to carry out cyber attacks against each other. Israel has also been accused of carrying out cyber attacks against Iran’s nuclear program.

# Israel situation

The National Cyber Security Authority (NCSA) is a government entity responsible for protecting Israeli civilian cyberspace. It is located within the Prime Minister’s office1. The NCSA was established in 2015 to lead the operational cybersecurity efforts of the State of Israel2. The Israeli government has put significant effort into unifying the different civilian cybersecurity agencies into one single entity, called the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD)3. The INCD is part of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office3.

The INCD is responsible for coordinating and leading Israel’s national cybersecurity efforts3. It works closely with other government agencies, including the Shin Bet and Mossad3. The INCD is also responsible for developing and implementing Israel’s national cybersecurity strategy.

The Israeli military also has a dedicated unit for cybersecurity called Unit 82003. The unit is responsible for collecting intelligence and conducting cyber operations. Unit 8200 has been involved in several high-profile cyber operations, including the Stuxnet worm attack on Iran’s nuclear program in 20103.

Cybersecurity is an important issue for Israel due to its geopolitical position. Israel has been targeted by cyber-attacks from various countries, including Iran4. Cybersecurity is also important for Israel’s economy, which relies heavily on technology and innovation3.

# Iran situation

According to a report by the Washington Post, Iran has been targeting Israeli systems with cyber attacks1. The opening shot of Iran’s cyber campaign against Israel was when the IDF thwarted an attempt to attack the country’s water desalination system in April 20202. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to attack Israeli systems, including the successful attack on the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera in October 20212.

The Iranian government has not disclosed information about its cybersecurity entities. However, it is known that Iran has a dedicated unit for cybersecurity called the Passive Defense Organization. The organization is responsible for protecting Iran’s critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks. The organization is also believed to be involved in developing and implementing Iran’s national cybersecurity strategy.

Cybersecurity is an important issue for Iran due to its geopolitical position. Iran has been targeted by cyber-attacks from various countries, including Israel1.

# Different strategies

Israel has established a public cybersecurity plan, which was not in place before 2017. The goal is to establish a comprehensive defence and international cooperation. 
However, there is no implementation plan yet. The military hires and trains personnel for cyber defence and intelligence skills, while the state supports the private sector to help protect civilians. 
Iran has not published any official cybersecurity strategy but uses cyber tools more offensively and in line with geopolitical interests. Cyberwar is viewed as a way to damage enemies and is an ingredient of a continuum of conflict. 
Iran actively supports private groups because they are more skilled in conducting operations. Israel has an INCD in the government that coordinates operations and has developed the NISA for intelligence and offensive operations.
In the private sector, NSO and Cellebrite are absolute leaders in the market of spyware and forensics. Israel’s state has an elite force of hacking. 
Iran has a supreme council for cyberspace that aims to exploit enemies and protect the Islamic Republic. It also has an NCC to develop internal strategies. 
Non-government groups like Mabna and hacking groups like Charming Kitten and OilRig have also been formed.
