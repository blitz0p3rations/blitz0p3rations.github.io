The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently disclosed a sophisticated cyber intrusion targeting a government agency's critical infrastructure. This article delves into the attacker's methods, techniques, and potential motivations, as documented by CISA analysts, providing a comprehensive breakdown of the attack. {: .lead} <!–-break-–>

# Initial Access and Credential Exploitation

The cyber threat actor gained initial network access by leveraging valid credentials from several Microsoft Office 365 (O365) and domain administrator accounts, classified under "Valid Accounts" [T1078]. This phase underscores the critical need for robust access control and vigilant monitoring systems. 

**Key Details:**
- **Entry Point:** The attacker logged into an O365 account from IP address 91.219.236[.]166, accessing a SharePoint site and downloading sensitive files.
- **Possible Exploit:** Analysts speculate that the attacker might have exploited a known vulnerability in an unpatched VPN server—CVE-2019-11510 in Pulse Secure—to gain unauthorized access [T1212].

**Patch Management:** The failure to apply critical updates to Pulse Secure, despite available patches for vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-11510, highlights the necessity of timely patch management.

# Exploration and Account Manipulation

Upon gaining access, the attacker embarked on "Discovery" [TA0007], probing for additional information and exploiting system vulnerabilities.

**Activities Undertaken:**
- **Email Account Surveillance:** The attacker accessed an O365 email account from IP address 91.219.236[.]166, targeting help desk emails related to "Intranet access" and "VPN passwords."
- **Active Directory and Group Policy Manipulation:** Changes were made to a registry key for the Group Policy [T1098], utilizing Windows command line processes and plink.exe for deeper system and network probing.

# Establishing Persistence and Command and Control

The actor methodically established "Persistence" [TA0003] and set up "Command and Control" [TA0011] channels within the compromised network.

**Strategies Used:**
- **Persistent SSH Tunnel/Reverse SOCKS Proxy:** The attacker created a secure communication channel using inetinfo.exe, a unique multi-stage malware.
- **Locally Mounted Remote Share:** A remote share was set up on IP address 78.27.70[.]237 [T1090], enabling discreet movement within the network.

# Data Collection and Exfiltration

The attacker demonstrated sophistication in "Data Collection" and "Exfiltration" [T1136], carefully avoiding detection.

**Exfiltration Techniques:**
- **Local Account Creation:** A new account was used for browsing directories and copying files to a locally mounted remote share.
- **PowerShell Interaction:** The actor employed PowerShell module Invoke-TmpDavFS.psm for file manipulation.
- **Data Exfiltration Methods:** Usage of tsclient for data transfer and creation of Zip files for potential data exfiltration.

# Conclusion

CISA's thorough investigation of this cyber intrusion provides key insights into modern cyber threats. The incident emphasizes the criticality of proactive cybersecurity measures like patch management, rigorous access controls, vigilant network monitoring, and comprehensive incident response strategies. Both public and private sector organizations can draw valuable lessons from this incident to fortify their defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and secure their critical infrastructure more effectively.
