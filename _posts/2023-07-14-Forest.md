# Forest HTB

## Type of activity and objectives
The objective of this activity is to conduct a penetration test on the target system, utilizing a machine within the same network. This test aims to assess the security posture of the target, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially exploit them to simulate real-world attack scenarios. 
By performing this penetration test from within the same network, we can assess the effectiveness of the network segmentation and security controls while identifying potential risks that an insider threat might exploit. 
The results of this test will provide valuable insights into the overall security of the target system and guide the implementation of necessary remediation measures to enhance its defences.
## Scope of evalutaion
The scope of evaluation for this assessment encompasses the target network and specific IP address. During this evaluation, we will focus on assessing the security of the designated network and the identified IP address. Our analysis will include identifying potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and areas of concern within the given network and IP range. Through thorough testing and analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into the security posture of the target network and IP, highlighting any potential risks that may need to be addressed.
## Executive Summary
The security assessment conducted on the target environment revealed significant vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise the organization's security. The identified vulnerabilities include ASREP Roasting, the abuse of permissions, and consequently secrets dumping. 
This report provides a detailed analysis of these vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and recommended remediation steps to mitigate the risks associated with them.
## Finding summary
- ASREP Roasting
- Abusing Permission
- Secrets Dumping to Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
## Attack storyline or vulnerabilities with MITRE mapping, CVE and with remediations
The attacker initiates the reconnaissance phase by conducting port scanning and LDAP querying analysis against the target network. This activity is in line with the MITRE technique T1046 - Network Service Scanning. By identifying open ports and querying the LDAP directory, the attacker gains insights into the organization's network architecture and potentially discovers valuable information about users and systems.

This data was then used to create a custom wordlist for password spraying attempts.

With the wordlist in hand, we attempted password spraying against multiple user accounts within the network. Password spraying involves trying a limited set of common passwords against a large number of accounts, aiming to identify weak credentials that might grant unauthorized access.

Despite our efforts, the password spraying attempts were unsuccessful. None of the accounts tested were compromised using the common passwords in our wordlist. 

- Initial Access (T1078 Valid Accounts): Our LDAP enumeration and wordlist creation fall under this technique, as we aimed to identify valid accounts within the network.
- Credential Access (T1110 Brute Force): The failed password spraying attempt aligns with this technique, where adversaries use brute force or dictionary attacks to obtain valid credentials.

### ASREP Roasting
After compiling a list of users through the LDAP querying analysis, the attacker attempts to exploit the ASREP Roasting vulnerability. This involves requesting an encrypted AS-REP ticket from the Kerberos authentication system for a specific user, and attempting to crack the ticket offline to retrieve the user's plaintext password. This technique aligns with MITRE's T1558.003 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: AS-REP Roasting.
### PoC

- During the assessment, the ASREP Roasting technique was employed to target accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled.
- The attack involved requesting a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for the user with Pre-Authentication disabled.
- The ticket request was made to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), and a service ticket was received without requiring a valid password.
- This "roasted" service ticket contained encrypted information that could be targeted for offline brute-force decryption.
- The encrypted service ticket obtained from the ASREP Roasting attack was subjected to offline password cracking using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.
- After successfully cracking the ticket's password, the plaintext credentials were obtained.
- These credentials were then used to authenticate via Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

With valid credentials, access to the target system was achieved, enabling remote administration and control.

### Remediations
- Use Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies for user accounts, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes. This will make it more difficult for attackers to crack passwords using offline techniques.

- Disable Pre-Authentication: Consider disabling pre-authentication for accounts that don't require it. This prevents attackers from requesting AS-REP tickets for those accounts and reduces the attack surface.

- Implement Account Lockout Policies: Set up account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account should be temporarily locked.

- Monitor for Unusual Behavior: Implement monitoring solutions that can detect and alert unusual authentication patterns, such as multiple failed AS-REP requests for different users.
### Abusing Permission
With a list of user accounts at hand, the attacker starts abusing permissions to escalate privileges within the target environment. The attacker leverages weakly protected or misconfigured permissions on various resources to gain unauthorized access. This aligns with MITRE's T1069 - Permission Groups Discovery and T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation. The attacker's goal is to move laterally within the network and access more critical systems.
### PoC
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) outlines a series of actions taken after gaining initial access to a target system. These actions involve exploiting permission weaknesses for potential privilege escalation and lateral movement.

1. Creating a User:
During the penetration test, a user account was created on the compromised system. This user account was established with specific intentions for escalating privileges and performing lateral movement.

2. Adding to the "Exchange Windows Permissions" Group:
The attacker added the newly created user to the "Exchange Windows Permissions" group. By doing so, the attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges related to Exchange services, which might offer broader access than a regular user.

3. Adding to the "Remote Management Users" Group:
The attacker also added the user to the "Remote Management Users" group. This group membership was intended to provide the attacker with remote access rights, which could enable the execution of commands and management tasks remotely.

4. Abusing Weak DACLs for DCSync Rights:
The PoC hints at exploiting weak permissions on Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) to gain DCSync rights. DCSync is a technique used to request Active Directory domain controller synchronization, potentially resulting in the extraction of password hashes from user accounts, including sensitive service accounts and administrators.

### Remediations
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Apply the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. Avoid granting excessive or unnecessary privileges.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC, which defines roles with specific permissions based on job responsibilities. Assign users to appropriate roles rather than granting individual permissions.

- Regular Permission Reviews: Conduct regular reviews of user permissions to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate. Remove any unnecessary or outdated permissions.

- Segregation of Duties (SoD): Separate critical tasks to prevent a single user from having all the necessary permissions to perform a malicious action.
### Secrets Dumping to Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
Despite failing initial password spraying attempts, the attacker exploits misconfigured systems or weak access controls to dump secrets from memory. This involves extracting sensitive data such as passwords or tokens that could lead to further unauthorized access. The attacker abuses the extracted secrets to escalate privileges and potentially achieve their objectives. This activity corresponds to MITRE's T1003 - Credential Dumping.
### PoC
Utilizing the Impacket tool "impacket-secretsdump," the attacker extracted secrets from the compromised system. This included obtaining the NTLM hash of the Administrator user.

Armed with the extracted NTLM hash, the attacker performed a Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack to authenticate as the Administrator. This granted the attacker domain admin rights and full control over the domain.

### Remediations
- Encryption of Sensitive Data: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.

- Implement Strong Authentication: Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing critical systems and sensitive data. This adds layer of security even if credentials are compromised.

- Privilege Management: Implement strict access controls and limit users' access to sensitive systems and data based on the principle of least privilege.

- Secrets Management: Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and distribute credentials and other sensitive information.
