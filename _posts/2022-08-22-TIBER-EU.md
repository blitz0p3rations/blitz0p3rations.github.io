In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity threats have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous. Financial institutions, as prime targets for cyberattacks, are under constant pressure to protect their assets, customers, and reputation from cyber threats. In response to this ever-growing risk, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) collaborated to develop the Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming for the European Union (TIBER-EU) framework. This article will explore the TIBER-EU assessment process, its key actors, and the reasons why it is a crucial evaluation for financial institutions. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

# Understanding TIBER-EU

TIBER-EU is an innovative and standardized framework designed to assess and improve the cybersecurity resilience of financial institutions. It goes beyond traditional penetration testing by incorporating threat intelligence, simulating real-life attack scenarios, and offering a more comprehensive evaluation of an institution's security posture, by studying and emulating threat actors that are active in the specific sector of the target organization.

# The Assessment Process

- Scoping: The first step in a TIBER-EU assessment is to define the scope and objectives of the test. The financial institution collaborates with the relevant national authority, which acts as the facilitator, and outlines the scope of the assessment based on its specific risks and vulnerabilities.

- Intelligence Gathering: Threat intelligence plays a crucial role in TIBER-EU assessments. The red team, responsible for performing the assessment, gathers information about the financial institution, including its technology, infrastructure, security policies, and recent cyber threats targeting similar organizations.

- Scenario Development: Using the gathered intelligence, the red team devises a realistic attack scenario that reflects the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of actual cyber adversaries. This customized scenario ensures the test aligns with the institution's unique risk profile.

- Engagement: The red team launches the simulated cyber attack, attempting to compromise the financial institution's systems, steal sensitive data, or disrupt critical operations, all while following the predefined attack scenario.

- Reporting: Throughout the engagement, the red team documents their findings and observations. After the assessment, they provide a detailed report to the institution, highlighting vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement.

# Key Actors in TIBER-EU

- Financial Institutions: Banks, payment service providers, and other financial entities subject to the European Central Bank's prudential supervision are the primary participants in TIBER-EU assessments. Their proactive engagement in this evaluation is crucial to enhance their cybersecurity resilience.

- National Authorities: The national authorities act as facilitators between the financial institutions and the red team. They help define the scope, ensure compliance with the framework, and manage the overall assessment process.

- Red Team: The red team consists of skilled cybersecurity professionals who are experts in penetration testing and ethical hacking. They conduct the simulated cyberattacks and provide valuable insights to the financial institutions.

# Importance of TIBER-EU Assessment

- Real-World Testing: TIBER-EU offers financial institutions an opportunity to undergo realistic and dynamic cyber attack simulations. This approach allows them to better understand their weaknesses and proactively address potential threats.

- Enhanced Cyber Resilience: By leveraging threat intelligence and replicating sophisticated attack scenarios, TIBER-EU enables financial institutions to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses and response mechanisms.

- Regulatory Compliance: Participating in TIBER-EU assessments demonstrates a financial institution's commitment to cybersecurity and can help meet regulatory requirements imposed by the European Central Bank and other supervisory authorities.

# Scenario Example: Cyber Heist Simulation

Imagine a large European bank with an extensive online banking platform is preparing for a TIBER-EU assessment. The national authority and the red team collaborate with the bank's security team to develop a challenging scenario. The scenario involves a cybercriminal group attempting to conduct a coordinated cyber heist targeting high-net-worth individuals.

The red team begins the assessment by conducting extensive reconnaissance on the bank's systems, employees, and customers. They identify vulnerabilities in the bank's web applications, network infrastructure, and social engineering opportunities.

In the simulation, the red team employs various tactics, including spear-phishing emails to employees, exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, and conducting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to disrupt key banking services.

Throughout the assessment, the red team gains unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, attempts fraudulent transactions, and gains control of critical banking systems. The bank's security team is tasked with detecting and responding to these simulated attacks in real-time.

After the assessment, the red team presents a comprehensive report to the bank, detailing the vulnerabilities exploited, security gaps identified, and recommendations for improvement. The bank's security team can then use this valuable feedback to bolster their cybersecurity defenses and develop a more robust incident response plan.

# Conclusion

TIBER-EU is a groundbreaking cybersecurity assessment framework that empowers financial institutions to face the ever-evolving cyber threats with confidence. By combining threat intelligence and realistic attack simulations, TIBER-EU helps organizations identify vulnerabilities, enhance their cybersecurity resilience, and safeguard their assets and reputation. Participating in TIBER-EU assessments not only ensures regulatory compliance but also demonstrates a commitment to protecting customers and maintaining the trust of stakeholders in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
