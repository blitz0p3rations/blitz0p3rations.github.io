The following report presents a comprehensive walkthrough and analysis of a recently completed Hack The Box (HTB) challenge. This write-up aims to provide insight into the methodologies, techniques, and thought processes employed to successfully tackle the challenge. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

# Mantis HTB

## Type of activity and objectives
The objective of this activity is to conduct a penetration test on the target system, utilizing a machine within the same network. This test aims to assess the security posture of the target, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially exploit them to simulate real-world attack scenarios. 
By performing this penetration test from within the same network, we can assess the effectiveness of the network segmentation and security controls while identifying potential risks that an insider threat might exploit. 
The results of this test will provide valuable insights into the overall security of the target system and guide the implementation of necessary remediation measures to enhance its defences.
## Scope of evalutaion
The scope of evaluation for this assessment encompasses the target network and specific IP address. During this evaluation, we will focus on assessing the security of the designated network and the identified IP address. Our analysis will include identifying potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and areas of concern within the given network and IP range. Through thorough testing and analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into the security posture of the target network and IP, highlighting any potential risks that may need to be addressed.
## Executive Summary
This report outlines a security assessment conducted on the target network, focusing on two critical findings: exposed credentials and the exploitation of the MS14-068 vulnerability. 
The assessment revealed a significant security concern related to exposed credentials. Through meticulous enumeration and analysis, the attacker identified instances where sensitive authentication information was unintentionally accessible. This situation poses a grave risk to the confidentiality and integrity of the organization's resources and data.
An analysis of the target environment uncovered a critical vulnerability stemming from the MS14-068 exploit, a Windows Kerberos vulnerability. This weakness allows for privilege escalation by forging Kerberos tickets. In this case, the attacker successfully leveraged the exploit to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
## Finding summary
- Exposed credentials
- MS14-068
## Attack storyline or vulnerabilities with MITRE mapping, CVE and with remediations

T1590 - Conduct Active Scanning: The attacker initiates the reconnaissance phase by actively scanning the target network for open ports and services.
T1046 - Network Service Scanning: The attacker employs network service scanning to identify open ports and services on the target systems.

Through the port scanning results, the attacker identifies exposed web servers within the target network.

### Exposed credentials
T1201 - Password Policy Discovery: The attacker's actions involve probing the password policy to exploit vulnerabilities.


### PoC
During the engagement, the attacker conducted path fuzzing on the target application, which led to the discovery of an exposed encoded set of credentials.

These credentials were used to access the Database, where further analysis revealed the presence of additional credentials.

### Remediations
- Never expose secrets
### MS14-068
T1208 - Kerberoasting: This technique maps to the attacker's exploitation of the MS14-068 vulnerability, where they manipulated Kerberos tickets for privilege escalation.
T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: The successful exploitation aligns with the attacker's ability to forge Kerberos tickets and elevate privileges.


### PoC
Exploiting the MS14-068 vulnerability, which specifically targets Kerberos, presents an opportunity to forge Kerberos tickets utilizing the permissions of a domain user. To facilitate this process, the "impacket-goldenPac" tool was employed, which automates the exploitation of this vulnerability.

To effectively utilize "impacket-goldenPac," it is necessary to modify the "/etc/hosts" file to include the domain's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as follows.

Once this configuration is in place, the "impacket-goldenPac" tool can be employed to achieve a SYSTEM-level shell on the target system. This exploit operation aligns with the following MITRE ATT&CK technique:

T1208 - Kerberoasting: The attacker exploits the MS14-068 vulnerability to forge Kerberos tickets, gaining unauthorized access and control over a target system.
By successfully leveraging this exploit, the attacker gains a SYSTEM shell, illustrating the potential consequences of unpatched vulnerabilities and the significance of timely updates to mitigate such risks.
