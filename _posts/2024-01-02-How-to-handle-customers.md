In this article, the process of customer communication and management during penetration testing activities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of clear and effective interaction from the initial assessment phase to the final report delivery. {: .lead} <!–-break-–>

# Managing Customer Relations in Penetration Testing
## Scoping Phase
In this phase, communication typically occurs between the company's salesperson, the team leader, and the penetration tester. The duty of the penetration tester is to estimate the required workdays for a detailed assessment, considering report production time, such as in mobile app or external perimeter testing.

Accuracy is crucial in this stage. If there is any doubt, reaching out to the salesperson for a customer call is advisable to gain clearer context. This is important as salespersons may not always provide complete technical details necessary for precise estimation.

After workdays are estimated, the information is relayed through the salesperson who prepares and sends the quotation to the customer. Acceptance of the quotation leads to the next steps of arranging the activity.

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
Post the pre-sales process, the team leader provides a document containing customer contact information, the preferred timeline, and specific targets including those that are out of scope.

## Activity Setup
The next step involves contacting the customer to set up a meeting for discussing details and prerequisites. This meeting is an opportunity to understand the customer's threat model, gather information about the test targets, identify critical functionalities and assets, and discuss any internal access requirements. Providing pre-prepared documents on setting up virtual machines for internal access, VPN configurations, and credentials for authenticated tests is recommended.

An agreement on the standard of communication, whether through email or platforms like Slack, is established. The start date of the engagement is also fixed during this phase, ensuring all prerequisites are ready beforehand.

## Start of Activities
The commencement of the activity is formally announced via email.

## Weekly Updates
Maintaining regular contact with the customer involves providing weekly updates. These updates include a summary of the ongoing activities, observations, and well-implemented aspects noticed during the testing.

## Immediate Communication on Critical Findings
Discovery of any critical vulnerabilities necessitates immediate communication with the customer, along with remediation steps for swift addressing. Reverification of the fix and notification to the customer is also part of this process.

## Activity Completion
Upon completion of the activities, an email is sent to the customer announcing the end of the engagement. This is also the time to request a telephone number for secure report delivery.

## Report Delivery
The penetration testing report is delivered to the customer, with availability slots offered for a debriefing meeting.

## Report Discussion
The final phase involves discussing the report with the customer. This discussion highlights the findings in the context of their environment, demonstrating the impacts. Detailed remediation steps are provided to ensure effective resolution of identified issues.
