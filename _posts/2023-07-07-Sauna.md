The following report presents a comprehensive walkthrough and analysis of a recently completed Hack The Box (HTB) challenge. This write-up aims to provide insight into the methodologies, techniques, and thought processes employed to successfully tackle the challenge. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

# Sauna HTB

## Type of activity and objectives
The objective of this activity is to conduct a penetration test on the target system, utilizing a machine within the same network. This test aims to assess the security posture of the target, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially exploit them to simulate real-world attack scenarios. 
By performing this penetration test from within the same network, we can assess the effectiveness of the network segmentation and security controls while identifying potential risks that an insider threat might exploit. 
The results of this test will provide valuable insights into the overall security of the target system and guide the implementation of necessary remediation measures to enhance its defences.
## Scope of evalutaion
The scope of evaluation for this assessment encompasses the target network and specific IP address. During this evaluation, we will focus on assessing the security of the designated network and the identified IP address. Our analysis will include identifying potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and areas of concern within the given network and IP range. Through thorough testing and analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into the security posture of the target network and IP, highlighting any potential risks that may need to be addressed.
## Executive Summary
The presented attack scenario involves several key vulnerabilities and tactics, as mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 

1. **AS-REP Roasting (TGS-0003)**:
   The attack begins with the identification of user accounts that are vulnerable to AS-REP Roasting, a technique where an attacker can request and crack offline Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets. This allows attackers to potentially obtain the password hashes of targeted accounts.

2. **AutoLogon Credentials Exposed (T1212)**:
   The attacker leverages the extracted password hashes to gain unauthorized access to accounts with AutoLogon enabled. AutoLogon credentials are often stored in plain text within the Windows registry, providing attackers with easy access to credentials and unauthorized entry into systems.

3. **Abusing Permissions (T1069)**:
   Exploiting the unauthorized access, the attacker abuses permissions to escalate privileges and gain access to resources beyond their initial scope. This tactic involves taking advantage of improperly configured or overly permissive access controls to navigate through the network and reach sensitive data or systems.

By combining these tactics, the attacker can compromise the target system and gain unauthorized access to user accounts, exposing potentially sensitive information and putting the organization's security at risk.

## Finding summary
- AS-REP Roasting
- AutoLogon credentials exposed
- Abusing permissions
## Attack storyline or vulnerabilities with MITRE mapping, CVE and with remediations

T1590 - Conduct Active Scanning: The attacker initiates the reconnaissance phase by actively scanning the target network for open ports and services.
T1046 - Network Service Scanning: The attacker employs network service scanning to identify open ports and services on the target systems.

Through the port scanning results and other common enumeration techniques, the attacker identifies exposed services within the target network.

### AS-REP Roasting

### PoC
In this Proof of Concept (PoC), an AS-REP Roasting attack is demonstrated using previously enumerated user accounts obtained from the "kerbrute" tool. The attack involves attempting to crack the AS-REP ticket, which can lead to the discovery of password hashes. Once the ticket is successfully cracked, the attacker gains access to the target machine.

### Remediations
- Use Kerberos Pre-authentication: Enable Kerberos Preauthentication for user accounts, which makes it more difficult for attackers to perform AS-REP Roasting attacks.

- Monitor Kerberos Traffic: Monitor network traffic for suspicious Kerberos ticket requests, failed authentication attempts, and other signs of AS-REP Roasting attacks.

- Implement Account Lockout: Implement account lockout policies that temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

### AutoLogon credentials exposed

### PoC
The identification of AutoLogon credentials through the use of tools like WinPEAS highlights potential security vulnerabilities. These credentials could be abused by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and move laterally within the network.

### Remediations
- Disable AutoLogon: Review and disable the AutoLogon feature on systems where it is not necessary. This will prevent the automatic login of users and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

- Review Autologon Configuration: If AutoLogon is required for specific purposes, ensure that the configuration is properly secured. Avoid using accounts with elevated privileges for AutoLogon.

- Password Management: Implement strong password policies for accounts used with AutoLogon. Use complex and unique passwords, and regularly rotate them.

### Abusing permissions

### PoC

The utilization of SharpHound and BloodHound tools to extract sensitive information and escalate privileges highlights the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access and potential compromise of the network.

### Remediations
- Least Privilege Principle: Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to users and groups. Only grant the minimum level of access required for users to perform their tasks.

- Regular Permission Audits: Conduct regular audits of user and group permissions to ensure that they are aligned with the roles and responsibilities of individuals. Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions.
