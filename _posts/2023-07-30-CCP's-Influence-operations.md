The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been known to conduct cyber-enabled influence operations to shape global narratives, control information flows, and promote its political agenda. Over the years, the CCP's cyber operations have evolved in sophistication and scale, leveraging advanced tactics and techniques to amplify its influence on a global stage. In this technical analysis, we will delve into the key components and strategies employed by the CCP in its increasingly sophisticated cyber-enabled influence operations. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

# Introduction
Presently—in targeted democracies—most political leaders, policymakers, businesses, civil society groups, and the public have limited comprehension of how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) presently engages in covert activities online in their countries, even though this behaviour is escalating and evolving rapidly. The stakes are high for democracies, given the essential nature of the internet and their dependence on open online spaces, free from interference. Despite years of monitoring clandestine CCP cyber-enabled influence operations by social-media platforms, governments, and research institutes like ASPI, conclusive public attribution of the entities propelling these activities is infrequent. Concealed online operations, by design, are arduous to detect and attribute to state actors. Social media platforms and governments struggle to allocate sufficient resources to identifying, preventing, and deterring escalating levels of malicious activity, and occasionally they are unwilling to identify and criticize the Chinese Government due to political, economic, and/or commercial motives.

# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups
The CCP's cyber-enabled influence operations are often executed by state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. These groups are composed of highly skilled and well-funded hackers who are tasked with carrying out long-term and stealthy campaigns. APT groups linked to the CCP, such as APT10 (also known as Stone Panda) and APT17 (also known as DeputyDog), have been implicated in various cyber operations targeting foreign governments, media organizations, think tanks, and businesses.
# Social Media Manipulation
The CCP leverages social media platforms to influence public opinion and spread its propaganda. It employs a range of tactics, including the use of social bots and fake accounts to amplify pro-CCP narratives and drown out dissenting voices. Additionally, "50 Cent Army" or "wu mao" commentators, who are individuals paid by the government to post pro-CCP content online, play a significant role in shaping online discussions and suppressing anti-government sentiments.
# Disinformation and Misinformation Campaigns
The CCP utilizes disinformation and misinformation campaigns to distort facts and narratives in its favour. Content manipulation techniques, such as deepfakes and forged documents, are used to create convincing but false information. These campaigns aim to confuse, deceive, and sway public opinion both domestically and internationally.
# Cyber Espionage and Intellectual Property Theft
The CCP conducts extensive cyber espionage campaigns to steal sensitive information, intellectual property, and trade secrets from foreign governments and businesses. This espionage enables the CCP to gain a competitive advantage in various industries, including technology, defence, and healthcare.
# Cyber Attacks on Media and Journalists
The CCP has been implicated in cyber attacks targeting media organizations and journalists critical of the government. These attacks often involve sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware distribution, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to silence dissenting voices and censor unfavourable reporting.
# Influence over International Organizations
The CCP seeks to exert its influence over international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), through cyber operations. By infiltrating these organizations' networks, the CCP can manipulate decisions and policies in its favour, advancing its geopolitical interests.
# Offensive Cyber Operations
The CCP has also demonstrated offensive cyber capabilities, engaging in targeted attacks against foreign governments and infrastructure. These attacks can range from cyber espionage to disrupting critical services, such as energy, transportation, and financial systems.

# Victims
Google (Operation Aurora):
In 2009, Google, along with several other major tech companies, fell victim to a large-scale cyber attack known as "Operation Aurora." This attack was attributed to APT1, a cyber espionage group believed to be associated with the Chinese military. The attack targeted the Gmail accounts of human rights activists and resulted in the theft of intellectual property.

Anthem Inc.:
In 2015, Anthem Inc., one of the largest health insurers in the United States, suffered a data breach that compromised the personal information of nearly 80 million individuals. The attack was attributed to a Chinese APT group and is believed to be part of a broader cyber espionage campaign targeting healthcare providers and insurers.

The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal:
In 2013, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that their networks had been breached by Chinese hackers. The attack targeted the media outlets' staff members who were investigating corruption within the Chinese government. The hackers used sophisticated techniques to gain unauthorized access to the newspapers' systems.

Uighur Human Rights Groups:
Uighur human rights groups have also been targets of cyber espionage campaigns associated with the CCP. These campaigns aim to monitor, infiltrate, and disrupt the activities of Uighur activists and organizations advocating for the rights of the Uighur minority in China.

# How to fight these problems?

- Social media platforms ought to leverage the digital infrastructure, which falls under their control, to more efficiently deter cyber-enabled influence operations. To disrupt future influence operations, social-media platforms could revoke access to those analytics for suspicious accounts that breach platform policies, thereby making it arduous for identified malicious actors to gauge the effectiveness of their influence operations.

- Social media platforms should pursue more cutting-edge information-sharing techniques to combat cyber-enabled influence operations. For instance, social-media platforms could disseminate more details about the digital infrastructure involved in influence operations, without divulging personally identifiable information.

- Governments should modify their language in speeches and policy documents to characterize social media platforms as critical infrastructure. By doing so, they would acknowledge the existing significance of those platforms in democracies and transmit signals to malicious actors that, akin to cyber operations on the power grid, efforts to meddle in the information ecosystem will be met with appropriate responses.

- Governments should reassess foreign interference legislation and contemplate mandating that social media platforms reveal state-backed influence operations and other transparency reports to enhance the public's awareness of potential threats.

- Public diplomacy should constitute a fundamental element of any counter-malign-influence strategy. Government leaders and diplomats should publicly denounce and attribute malign cyber-enabled influence operations, along with the entities involved (both state and non-state actors), to discourage such activities.

- Partners and allies should fortify intelligence diplomacy concerning this burgeoning security challenge and endeavour to exchange more intelligence with one another regarding these influence operations. Robust open-source intelligence capabilities and collection capacities are pivotal in investigating and attributing these operations, whose low classification should facilitate intelligence sharing.

- Governments should endorse further research on influence operations and other hybrid threats. To foster broader situational awareness of hybrid threats, including malign influence operations across the region, democracies should establish an Indo-Pacific hybrid threats centre.

# Conclusion
The CCP's cyber-enabled influence operations have become increasingly sophisticated and pose significant challenges to global cybersecurity and information integrity. Through advanced tactics, the CCP seeks to control narratives, suppress dissent, and shape public opinion both within China and on an international level. Understanding the technical aspects of these operations is crucial for governments, organizations, and individuals to implement effective cybersecurity measures and countermeasures to protect against the influence and potential threats posed by the CCP's cyber activities.
