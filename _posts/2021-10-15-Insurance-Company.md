# Insurance Company

## Type of activity and objectives
The objective of this engagement was to conduct a wireless penetration assessment for the organization. The aim was to identify potential vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited from outside sources, with the goal of preventing unauthorized access to the wireless network and compromise.
## Scope of evaluation
The evaluation was focused on the specific SSID assigned to the organization. 
## Executive Summary
The assessment of the wireless network infrastructure revealed a lack of vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that the limited on-site presence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic hindered the effectiveness of the conducted attacks. As a result, the attempted attacks by the team were largely unsuccessful in identifying vulnerabilities in the wireless network. It is recommended to continue monitoring and maintaining security measures to ensure the ongoing protection of the wireless network.
