The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming for the European Union (TIBER-EU) are two vital frameworks introduced by the European Commission to enhance the operational resilience of the financial sector in the European Union. While both initiatives share the common goal of fortifying the financial industry against cyber threats and operational disruptions, they differ in their approach and focus. This comprehensive article delves into the strengths and distinctions between TIBER-EU and DORA, shedding light on their significance for the EU financial sector. {: .lead} <!–-break-–> 

## Strengths of TIBER-EU
a. Realistic Attack Simulations: TIBER-EU emphasizes conducting realistic red teaming exercises that replicate actual cyber threats and adversary tactics, providing financial institutions with practical insights into their operational resilience.

b. Threat Intelligence Integration: The framework leverages threat intelligence to tailor attack scenarios specific to each institution's risk profile, ensuring assessments align with current and emerging cyber threats.

c. Comprehensive Assessment: TIBER-EU offers a holistic evaluation, covering people, processes, and technology, enabling financial institutions to identify weaknesses in their cybersecurity defences comprehensively.

d. Customization: The assessment's scope and approach are tailored to each institution's unique risk landscape, ensuring that the evaluation is highly relevant and focused on critical areas.

## Strengths of DORA
a. Regulatory Standardization: DORA introduces a standardized regulatory framework across the EU financial sector, ensuring a consistent approach to operational resilience and cybersecurity requirements.

b. Stress Testing and Scenario Replication: DORA mandates stress testing and scenario-based assessments, enabling financial institutions to evaluate their preparedness against a wide range of potential cyber threats and operational disruptions.

c. Comprehensive Risk Management: The act emphasizes advanced risk management practices, including continuous monitoring and reporting of cyber incidents, to proactively address potential threats.

d. Supervisory Oversight: DORA grants regulatory authorities enhanced supervisory powers to oversee the implementation of operational resilience measures and enforce compliance uniformly.

## Differences between TIBER-EU and DORA

### Scope and Applicability
TIBER-EU focuses primarily on assessing and enhancing the cybersecurity defences of financial institutions through red teaming exercises. It is a voluntary framework designed to address cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

DORA, on the other hand, is a legislative proposal that aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for operational resilience across the EU financial sector. It is mandatory for all relevant financial institutions, irrespective of their size or nature.

### Focus
TIBER-EU primarily concentrates on conducting realistic red teaming exercises to evaluate an institution's cybersecurity defences. The assessment aims to identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world cyber threats, allowing financial institutions to enhance their security posture proactively.
DORA, on the other hand, emphasizes a broader approach to operational resilience. It encompasses stress testing, risk management, and scenario-based assessments to evaluate an institution's ability to respond to operational disruptions beyond just cybersecurity incidents.

### Assessment Methodology
TIBER-EU employs red teaming exercises conducted by skilled cybersecurity professionals to simulate realistic cyber threats. It relies on threat intelligence to develop customized attack scenarios.

DORA mandates stress testing, scenario-based assessments, and incident reporting mechanisms to evaluate the resilience of financial institutions. It requires them to develop comprehensive risk management frameworks.

### Regulatory Oversight
TIBER-EU operates under the coordination of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). However, it does not involve extensive regulatory oversight.

DORA, once approved, will be enforced by the European Commission and the relevant National Competent Authorities (NCAs), granting them supervisory powers over financial institutions' operational resilience practices.

## Example Scenario: Cyber Attack Simulation
### TIBER-EU Approach
A large European bank decides to undergo a TIBER-EU assessment to test its cybersecurity defences. The bank collaborates with a red team comprising skilled cybersecurity professionals. The red team gathers threat intelligence and identifies potential weaknesses in the bank's systems and processes. The red team then simulates a sophisticated cyber attack, including phishing emails, social engineering, and attempts to exploit software vulnerabilities. Throughout the assessment, the red team emulates the tactics used by real-world threat actors. The bank's cybersecurity team actively monitors the simulated attack and responds to the threat in real-time. The TIBER-EU assessment provides the bank with valuable insights into its cybersecurity readiness, revealing areas that need improvement and helping them develop effective response strategies.

### DORA Approach
In this scenario, a financial institution is subject to DORA compliance requirements. The institution's risk management team conducts an extensive risk assessment, identifying critical business services and potential cyber threats. Based on the assessment, the institution develops a comprehensive risk management framework, encompassing incident response plans, business continuity strategies, and scenario-based stress tests. The institution engages external auditors to conduct testing and assurance exercises. These exercises simulate a range of cyber incidents, including data breaches, DDoS attacks, and supply chain disruptions. The auditors evaluate the institution's response capabilities and validate the effectiveness of its operational resilience measures. The institution submits a detailed report to the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA) showcasing its adherence to DORA requirements and its commitment to bolstering operational resilience.

# Conclusion
TIBER-EU and DORA are both crucial initiatives introduced by the European Commission to strengthen the operational resilience of the financial sector within the European Union. While TIBER-EU focuses on conducting realistic red teaming assessments and leveraging threat intelligence, DORA aims to standardize operational resilience requirements and enhance regulatory oversight. By complementing each other's strengths, these frameworks collectively contribute to creating a more secure and resilient financial ecosystem in the EU, better prepared to mitigate evolving cyber threats and operational disruptions.
