## Introduction
As a human rights advocate, reading Marjane Satrapi's "Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood" was not just an act of literature but a profound connection to a shared history of resilience and longing for freedom. This graphic novel, which so vividly portrays the life of a young Iranian girl amidst the turbulent backdrop of the Islamic Revolution and its aftermath, is a poignant reminder of the countless untold stories of Iranians yearning for their basic human rights while the world often turns a blind eye.

# Personal oppression
"In life, you'll meet a lot of jerks. If they hurt you, tell yourself that it's because they're stupid. That will help keep you from reacting to their cruelty. Because there is nothing worse than bitterness and vengeance... Always keep your dignity and be true to yourself."

These words resonate deeply with those of us who have lived in a society where our voices are suppressed, and our dignity is constantly under threat. Marjane's journey, though unique in its details, reflects the inner struggle that many Iranians face daily. Her determination to preserve her identity and heritage, even in the face of adversity, mirrors the collective spirit of Iranians who refuse to be silenced.

## Freedom as a price
"Freedom has a price."

Marjane's experiences shed light on the price of freedom. In a society where speaking out can lead to imprisonment or worse, her story reminds us that the fight for basic human rights often comes at a high cost. Iranians who dare to defy the oppressive regime understand this truth intimately. "Persepolis" serves as a testament to the courage of those who continue to resist, no matter the risks.

## The Global Responsibility
Reading "Persepolis" can be both a source of pride and frustration. Pride in the resilience of our people and the courage of those who stand up for justice, but also frustration at the world's often indifferent stance towards our struggle. It is disheartening to see the international community at times turn a blind eye to the violation of our human rights.

"Persepolis" is a call to action for the world to pay attention, to acknowledge the suffering of Iranians, and to stand with us in our quest for freedom and justice. It reminds us that the fight for human rights is not limited by borders; it is a universal struggle that demands solidarity and support.
