Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.

It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. {: .lead} <!--break-->

Before setting up a phishing campaign, it's crucial to assess misconfigurations within the targeted domains. Exploiting these misconfigurations can make the phishing setup more effective. Here are some steps to consider:

### Domain SPF Validation:
To identify whether a domain is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, you can check its SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record. SPF helps prevent email spoofing by specifying authorized mail servers for sending emails on behalf of the domain. Follow these steps to check the domain's SPF record using MXToolbox's SPF Record Lookup:

1. Go to the MXToolbox website (https://mxtoolbox.com/).
2. In the search bar, enter "SPF Record Lookup" and press enter.
3. Enter the domain you want to check in the text field.
4. Click the "SPF Record Lookup" button.

The tool will retrieve and display the domain's SPF record. If the record includes a "v=spf1 -all" directive, the domain is protected against spoofing. If it's blank or includes a "v=spf1 ?all" directive, the domain may be vulnerable to spoofing.

### Gathering Subdomain List:
Compile a list of subdomains related to the target organization. Tools like Sublist3r, Subfinder, and Findomain can assist in subdomain enumeration. Identifying relevant subdomains can enhance the authenticity of your phishing attempt.

### Domain Purchase:
When acquiring a domain for phishing, consider the reputation of the domain provider. Reputable providers may have security measures against phishing domains. Opt for providers with a lower reputation to bypass such measures.

Choose a domain name thoughtfully:
- Avoid using typos or misspelt versions of the target organization's name, as they might be monitored.
- Instead, use generic names related to your phishing goal (e.g., "email.domain.com" for targeting email credentials).
- Expired domain names can help evade email reputation checks.

By examining domain misconfigurations and using appropriate domain-related strategies, you can enhance the success of your phishing campaigns while minimizing the chances of detection and mitigation.

Indeed, purchasing an expired domain can be an effective strategy for phishing campaigns, as these domains often come with a pre-existing reputation and may have been verified in the past. Expired domains can make it easier to bypass email reputation checks and other security measures. Here are the steps to consider when using an expired domain for your phishing campaign:

1. **Domain Research:** Visit websites like [ExpiredDomains.net](https://www.expireddomains.net/) to search for expired domains that fit your criteria. You can filter domains based on various parameters such as domain name, keywords, extension, and more.

2. **Domain Reputation:** Look for expired domains with a good reputation and a history of legitimate use. Check for domains that have not been used for malicious activities in the past.

3. **Domain History:** Investigate the history of the expired domain. Check for any signs of previous abuse or suspicious activity associated with the domain. Use tools like [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to view the historical context of the domain.

4. **Purchase Domain:** Once you find a suitable expired domain, follow the process to purchase it. Some domain providers specialize in selling expired domains, and they often provide details about the domain's history and reputation.

5. **Domain Transition:** After acquiring the expired domain, make sure to transfer ownership to your account and update the domain's DNS settings to point to your hosting environment.

6. **Phishing Setup:** Set up your phishing content (e.g., landing pages, emails) on the acquired expired domain. Customize the content to match the context and target of your phishing campaign.

7. **Campaign Execution:** Launch your phishing campaign using the acquired expired domain. Monitor the campaign's performance and gather the desired information from your targets.

8. **Post-Campaign:** After the campaign is completed, you might choose to dispose of the expired domain or keep it for future campaigns. Be aware of the ethical and legal implications of using expired domains for malicious purposes.

Using an expired domain can provide you with an advantage in terms of domain reputation and avoiding email reputation checks.

## Scenario: Testing Evilginx2 and Token Theft

To test the correct functionality of Evilginx2 and understand the process of token theft, follow this scenario:

1. **Choose a Valid Account:**
   - To properly test Evilginx2, use a valid account that corresponds to the phishlet you are testing. For example, if you're testing the Office 365 phishlet, use an account that is associated with Office 365.

2. **Access the Phishing Site:**
   - Use the lure URL you generated in Evilginx2.
   - Enter the valid credentials of the chosen account (username and password).

3. **Evaluate Site Response:**
   - Depending on whether you used a valid account, the site's response will differ.
   - If the account is meant for the targeted service (e.g., Office 365), the site may prompt you for additional information, like a 2FA token.
   - If the account isn't relevant to the targeted service, the site might display an error or other feedback.

4. **Check Captured Sessions:**
   - Inside the Evilginx2 terminal, type `: sessions` to see captured sessions.
   - Examine the information that has been captured from the phishing attempts.

5. **Inspect Specific Session:**
   - To examine a specific captured session, use `: session session_ID`.

6. **Review Captured Credentials and Tokens:**
   - If Evilginx2 has successfully captured credentials and a 2FA token, you'll see relevant information in the captured session details.
   - The details might include the captured username, password, and token.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blitz0p3rations/blitz0p3rations.github.io/master/uploads/aws3.png)

7. **Use Captured Token:**
   - Install a cookie editor extension in your browser.
   - Navigate to the targeted service's login page (e.g., Office 365).
   - Click on the login form, and then open the cookie editor extension.
   - Import the captured token using the "Import JSON" feature of the cookie editor.
   - Reload the page.
   
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blitz0p3rations/blitz0p3rations.github.io/master/uploads/aws4.png)
8. **Access the Compromised Account:**
   - If the process is successful, the compromised token will grant you access to the targeted service (e.g., Office 365) without requiring additional authentication steps.
   - This demonstrates how an attacker can gain unauthorized access using stolen tokens.

#### EXTRA: Setting Up a Caddy Redirector and Configuring Custom Firewall Rules for Security

These rules will ensure that only authorized connections are allowed to various components of the system.

Here's how the firewall rules will be set up:

1. **SSH Access:**
   - Only the IP address of the operator (`operator_ip`) will be allowed to log in over SSH using the provided SSH keys.

2. **SMTP Traffic:**
   - The GoPhish server will be restricted to sending SMTP traffic only to the phishing server, preventing unauthorized outbound email communication.

3. **DNS Access:**
   - The servers will have unrestricted access to any DNS server to ensure seamless domain name resolution.

4. **HTTP/HTTPS Access:**
   - Open access will be granted to any IP for HTTP and HTTPS ports. However, for improved security, consider narrowing down this access to specific IP ranges if available.

5. **GoPhish Admin Port:**
   - Only the `operator_ip` will be able to access the GoPhish admin port, which will be configured on a custom port.

Here's how the flow will work:

1. **Operator Login:**
   - The operator will log in to the GoPhish dashboard via HTTPS on the designated custom port.

2. **Email Sending:**
   - Once the phishing campaign is ready, the GoPhish server will utilize Amazon SES to send out the phishing emails to the intended recipients.

3. **Phishing Link:**
   - Upon recipient interaction, such as opening an email or clicking a link, they will be directed to a custom subdomain. This subdomain will host the fake login page designed for the phishing attack.

Here's an example of how you can set up a Caddy server to serve as a redirector for your phishing infrastructure:

1. **Install Caddy:**

   You can use Caddy's official website to get the installation script:

   `
   curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal
   `

   This command will automatically download and install Caddy with the personal license.

2. **Create a Caddy Configuration File:**

   Create a Caddy configuration file, typically named `Caddyfile`, in the directory where you have Caddy installed. You can use a text editor to create and edit this file.

   `
   sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   `

3. **Add Your Redirector Configuration:**

   Add the following lines to your `Caddyfile`, adjusting the domain and IP address:

   `
   your-subdomain.your-domain.com {
       reverse_proxy http://evilnginx-server-ip
   }
   `
   
   Replace `your-subdomain.your-domain.com` with the custom subdomain to use for your phishing. This configuration will instruct Caddy to act as a reverse proxy, redirecting incoming requests to the `evilnginx-server-ip` where the fake login page is hosted.

4. **Save and Close the File:**

   After making the necessary changes, save and close the file. In Nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

5. **Restart Caddy:**

   Restart Caddy to apply the new configuration:

   `
   sudo systemctl restart caddy
   `

6. **Check Caddy Status:**

   You can check the status of Caddy to make sure it's running without errors:

   `
   sudo systemctl status caddy
   `

   If everything is configured correctly, you should see that Caddy is active and running.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific setup and requirements. 
#### Creating Fake Alerts in Phishing Emails

Administrators of Microsoft 365 often implement rules to flag emails from external sources, aiming to highlight potential phishing attempts. This practice helps users identify potentially risky emails. 

For instance, we can strategically use a negative margin to position our desired alert on top of the injected alert, effectively covering it up, giving the appearance that the email originated from an internal source without any alerts or warnings.

This manipulation showcases the challenge of relying solely on visual indicators to determine the legitimacy of an email. It's a reminder that attackers can skillfully manipulate elements to deceive recipients and make phishing emails appear more convincing. As a result, user education, vigilant security practices, and multi-layered security solutions are crucial to mitigating the risks posed by such tactics.

### Other ways for delivering the phishing link

Methods involve leveraging legitimate platforms and notifications to deliver malicious content, as you mentioned with Google Docs notifications. Here are a few other ways attackers might use to deliver phishing links:

1. **Collaboration Platforms:** Attackers might send phishing links through collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or other workplace communication tools. These platforms often send notifications to users when they receive messages or invitations, creating a sense of urgency that attackers exploit.

2. **Cloud Storage Services:** Attackers could use cloud storage services like Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive to host phishing files and share them with victims. The platforms' notification systems might entice users to click on links under the guise of accessing shared documents.

3. **Social Media:** Phishing links can be distributed through social media platforms, direct messages, and comments. Cybercriminals can impersonate trusted contacts, enticing recipients to click on links that lead to malicious sites.

4. **Instant Messaging Apps:** Attackers could send phishing links through messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Telegram. These apps often have push notifications that encourage users to engage with messages.

5. **Browser Notifications:** Some malicious websites may request permission to send browser notifications. Attackers can abuse this feature to push phishing links directly to users' devices.

6. **Email Forwarding:** Attackers might compromise a victim's email account and use it to forward phishing emails to their contacts. The emails appear to come from a familiar source, increasing the chances of recipients clicking on the links.

7. **QR Codes:** Phishers could distribute QR codes in physical locations or online. Scanning the code with a mobile device could lead to a phishing site.

8. **Voice and SMS:** Voice calls or SMS messages containing phishing links could be used to target mobile users.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, modern phishing vectors have evolved significantly to capitalize on human vulnerabilities and technological advancements. Cybercriminals leverage sophisticated techniques to deceive individuals and organizations, making it crucial for individuals and businesses to stay vigilant and implement robust cybersecurity measures.

Some key takeaways from modern phishing vectors include:

1. **Social Engineering:** Phishing attacks heavily rely on social engineering tactics, exploiting human emotions, curiosity, and trust to manipulate victims into taking actions that compromise their security.

2. **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks, known as spear phishing, tailor messages to specific individuals using personal information, making them more convincing and increasing the likelihood of success.

3. **Credential Harvesting:** Phishers often seek usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access. This information is then used for various malicious purposes, including identity theft and unauthorized account access.

4. **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** BEC attacks target employees with access to financial systems or sensitive information. Attackers impersonate executives, requesting fund transfers or sensitive data.

5. **Malware Delivery:** Phishing emails can contain malicious attachments or links that lead to malware-infested websites. Once opened or clicked, malware can compromise systems, steal data, or enable unauthorized access.

6. **URL Manipulation:** Phishers use URL manipulation techniques to mask malicious URLs with seemingly legitimate ones, increasing the likelihood of victims clicking on them.

7. **Brand Impersonation:** Attackers imitate trusted brands or services to deceive recipients into disclosing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.

8. **Mobile Phishing:** As mobile device usage grows, attackers increasingly target mobile users with SMS-based phishing (smishing) and malicious apps.

9. **Evading Security Measures:** Attackers constantly adapt to bypass security measures, using encryption, obfuscation, and evasion tactics to evade detection.

To defend against modern phishing vectors:

- **Education:** Regularly educate individuals about phishing risks, how to identify suspicious emails, and what steps to take if they encounter one.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA wherever possible to add an extra layer of security even if credentials are compromised.

- **Email Filtering:** Use advanced email filtering solutions that can identify and block phishing emails before they reach recipients' inboxes.

- **Security Updates:** Keep systems, software, and devices updated to patch vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

- **URL Analysis:** Use tools that analyze URLs for potential threats before clicking on them.

- **Employee Training:** Conduct ongoing cybersecurity training for employees to enhance their ability to recognize and report phishing attempts.

- **Strong Passwords:** Encourage the use of strong, unique passwords and discourage password sharing.

- **Domain Monitoring:** Monitor domain registrations and usage to prevent attackers from creating domains that impersonate your brand.

Modern phishing attacks require a multi-faceted approach, combining technological defences, user education, and proactive threat detection. Staying informed about the latest phishing trends and continuously adapting security practices is essential to effectively mitigate the risks posed by these evolving attack vectors.
