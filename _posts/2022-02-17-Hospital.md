# Hospital

## Type of activity and objectives
The objective of this engagement was to conduct an internal penetration assessment for the organization. The aim was to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be exploited by internal sources, with the ultimate goal of preventing unauthorized access, compromise, and data exfiltration.
## Scope of evaluation
The evaluation was focused on the internal surface of the organization. This scope encompassed assessing the security and potential vulnerabilities within this internal surface.
## Executive Summary
The conducted assessment on the target network infrastructure highlighted several significant security findings that require immediate attention. 
The vulnerabilities identified encompassed multiple attack vectors, ranging from information disclosure to critical remote code execution flaws.
## Finding Summary
- NFS Share Exported Information Disclosure 
- PATH traversal CVE-2018-7171
- HP laserjet printer no auth required
- Microsoft RDP RCE (CVE-2019-0708) (Bluekeep)
- MS17-010: Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server (EternalBlue)
- MS12-020: RDP allow Remote Code Execution
- VE Basic login with default credentials

## Attack storyline and findings
### NFS Share Exported Information Disclosure
- CVSS Vector: None
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
The assessment revealed that NFS shares were exposed and accessible without proper authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.
#### Remediations
- Disable Unnecessary NFS Shares: Identify and disable any NFS shares that are not required for legitimate business purposes. Limit the exposure of sensitive data by only sharing necessary files and directories.

- Implement Access Controls: Configure access controls and permissions for NFS shares to restrict access to authorized users and hosts. Use strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
### PATH traversal CVE-2018-7171
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
The presence of a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2018-7171) was identified, which could allow attackers to navigate beyond intended directory structures and access sensitive files.
Directory traversal vulnerability in Twonky Server 7.0.11 through 8.5 allows remote attackers to share the contents of arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the contentbase parameter to rpc/set_all.
#### Remediations
- Apply Patches and Updates: Check if your software or system is affected by CVE-2018-7171 and ensure that you have applied any available patches or updates provided by the vendor. These patches are typically designed to fix the vulnerability.
### HP laserjet printer no auth required
- CVSS Vector: None
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
An HP LaserJet printer was discovered with no authentication required, posing a security risk by allowing unauthorized access and potential misuse.
#### Remediations
- Add a layer of authentication
### Microsoft RDP RCE (CVE-2019-0708) (Bluekeep)
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
The assessment unveiled a vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution through Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), exposing systems to potential compromise.
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services formerly known as Terminal Services when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests, aka 'Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'.

#### Remediations
- Apply Security Patches: Ensure that all affected systems have the necessary security updates and patches installed. Microsoft released patches to address the BlueKeep vulnerability. Download and apply the relevant patches from Microsoft's official website.
### MS17-010: Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server (EternalBlue)
- CVSS Vector: None
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
The presence of the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010) was identified, which could be exploited for remote code execution on vulnerable systems.
#### Remediations
- Apply Security Patches: Ensure that all affected systems have the necessary security updates and patches installed. Microsoft released patches to address the MS17-010 vulnerability. Download and apply the relevant patches from Microsoft's official website
### MS12-020: RDP allow Remote Code Execution
- CVSS Vector: CVSS2#AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
A vulnerability in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was discovered, potentially leading to remote code execution.
An arbitrary remote code vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the remote Windows host. The vulnerability is due to the way that RDP accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted.

If RDP has been enabled on the affected system, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause the system to execute arbitrary code by sending a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets to it.
#### Remediations
- Apply Security Patch: Ensure that the affected system has the latest security updates installed. Download and apply the relevant security patch provided by Microsoft to address the MS12-020 vulnerability.
### VE Basic login with default credentials
- CVSS Vector: None
#### Proof of Concept (PoC) 
A security lapse involving the use of default credentials for VE Basic login was found, which could grant unauthorized access to the system.
#### Remediations
- Change default credentials
